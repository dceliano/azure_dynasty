*Azure Dynasty*: a mini-RPG written in Python.

To run the game, go into the folder "Final_Program" and, using Python 3, type `python Azure_Dynasty.py`. Note that this PyGame will probably not work out of the box on MacOS, since PyGame requires the SDL library which requires some configuration/installation on MacOS.

The game has been tested and works with PyGame 1.9.6.

Once in the game, use the following controls:
- W to take out or put away your weapon
- Hold A to attack an enemy
- "Save Game" to save your current progress and be able to later load that progress via "Load Game" on the main menu.
- "Main Menu" to return to the main menu and start a new game or load a previously saved game.
